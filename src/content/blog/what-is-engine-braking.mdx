  Engine braking is way of decreasing speed of your're bike without using
  brakes!

  You need to release throttle off & down-shift without using clutch. This will
  drastically decrease speed and save you in emergency condition

- It's mostly fine to use
- Use this in emergency condition because your speed will
  decrease a lot than normal brakes
- It's not recommended to down-shift at higher speeds
