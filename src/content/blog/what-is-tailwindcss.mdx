Hey there 👋! In this blog i'll explain what is tailwindcss, advantages of using it over CSS. TailwindCSS is a way of writing CSS, which is used in styling websites. Even my website is styled using tailwind!

<H2>Cons of CSS</H2>

- Repeating same properties again & again. In my previous company we've used `CSS` & `SASS` for styling. We've declared some common classes. Still we ended up create new classes which've same properties!
- Coming-up with different class names for styles to not overlap
- Increased bundle size because of repeating the same properties again & again!

<H2>Pros of TailwindCSS</H2>

- It' a combination of utility classes, the CSS properties are tailwind classes example👇

```html
<!-- Here i've 2 div's styled with CSS & TailwindCSS -->

<!-- This is Traditional CSS -->
<style>
  .container {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
  }
</style>

<div class="container"></div>

<!-- This is Tailwind classes -->
<div class="flex items-center justify-center"></div>
```

- Comes with Intellisence, auto-suggestion of classes🔥. Install this [plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)
- No need to come-up with weird class names😮‍💨
- Comes with a good Design System out of the box📦.
- Debugging will be easy because your styles & html lives at same place

<H2>TailwindCSS Plugins🔌</H2>

Tailwind plugins add super-powers to your App, these will extend your `tailwind.conifg` file, here are few plugins that i've used👇

- When it comes to learning TailwindCSS, my suggestion is get good at CSS first
- Finally during build time, Tailwind classes which you've will be converted into CSS
- If you understand CSS, then tailwind is just mappig of CSS properties to classes

<H2>What's next🤔</H2>

- Once you've learned tailwind, there are 2 ways choosing Component library
- Either you need to choose the library where you can use tailwind example👇
  - [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/accordion)
  - [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/accordion)
- Or you need to stick library using css example👇
  - [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
  - [Ant Design](https://ant.design/components/button)
- Don't try to mix a CSS component library with tailwind, it'll be a mess😵‍💫
